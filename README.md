# pi0_decay

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing anomalous showers resulting from pi0 decay in offline anomaly detection studies.

pi0 decays are simulated using sbndcode. Take LArCV files as input.

## Overview

The project focuses on identifying and studying anomalous electromagnetic showers in particle physics data, specifically those originating from neutral pion (pi0) decay. The analysis is performed offline using custom algorithms and scripts.
