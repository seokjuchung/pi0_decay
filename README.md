# pi0_decay

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing anomalous showers resulting from pi0 decay in offline anomaly detection studies.

## Overview

The project focuses on identifying and studying anomalous electromagnetic showers in particle physics data, specifically those originating from neutral pion (pi0) decay. The analysis is performed offline using custom algorithms and scripts.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - Source code for anomaly detection and analysis.
- `data/` - Example datasets and input files.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization.
- `docs/` - Additional documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pi0_decay.git
    cd pi0_decay
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run analysis scripts or explore notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Usage

Refer to the scripts in `src/` and notebooks in `notebooks/` for example workflows and analysis pipelines.
